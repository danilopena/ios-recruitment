# TechnicalTest

In this project i chose to make a currency converter and show some concepts of programation.
I've  structured my code using mainly: Object Oriented Programming and SRP (Single Responsability Principle).

# Warning points!

  - There is a .xcworkspace with a ThechnicalTest.project and a Network.project that is responsible for handling the API calls.
  - I wrote some XCTestCase's on the main functionalities of the app.
  - The layout was simplified due to the limited time frame while the main concern was to demonstrate the best practices of coding and the core concepts of programming.

# Architecture

I chose MVVM for this example with MARK's and "extensions" to organize the code. The comments placed on the methods aim to document the code and help to improve the maintainability.
